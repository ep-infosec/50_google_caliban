Custom Script Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``caliban run`` or ``caliban cloud`` modes, if you pass ``--`` to the CLI, Caliban
will stop parsing commands and pass everything after ``--`` through to your
script, untouched. If you run:

.. code-block:: bash

   caliban cloud trainer.train -- --epochs 2 --job_dir my_directory

Your script will execute inside the container environment with the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m trainer.train --epochs 2 --job_dir my_directory

This feature is compatible with :doc:`experiment_broadcasting` in ``cloud``,
``run`` or ``cluster`` mode; arguments are prepended to the list generated by
the specific experiment being executed from your experiment config.
